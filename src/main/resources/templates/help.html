    <h1>Chronic Reader Help</h1>
    <h2>Library Page</h2>
    <p class="images"><img src="/library.png" /></p>
    <p>This page lets you navigate the available collection of books and comics, search, view progress of books you have opened and read. New books are loaded as you scroll. Use the search field to look for available books. Click on a book or comic to start reading it. At the top of the page, the most recent books you read are displayed, up to six books. Books that are in progress have a progress bar displayed on top of their cover. Books that hae been read (cover to cover) have a checkmark displayed on top of their cover.</p>

    <h2>Collections Page</h2>
    <p class="images"><img src="/collection_tree.png" /></p>
    <p>Every book and comic is part of a collection, based on the folders and sub-folders it is stored in. The collections page displays all the collections in the app as a tree. For tree entries with a plus sign next to them you have sub-collections. You can click that plus sign to expand the collection and view sub-collections. You can organize your books and comics into collections by organizing them into sub-folders in your root library folder. Clicking on a collection name will take you back to the library page and only display the entries in that collection.</p>

    <h2>Book/Comic Page</h2>
    <p class="images"><img src="/book_controls.png" /></p>
    <p>You can use the higlighted areas of the screen to move between pages/views or to open the tools menu.</p>
    <p class="images"><img src="/menu_left.png" style="max-width: 32%; margin-right: 1%;"/><img src="/menu_right.png" style="max-width: 32%; margin-right: 1%;"/><img src="/menu_scrolled.png" style="max-width: 32%;"/></p>
    <p>The tools menu has a left-side and a right-side version, depending on the tools button you pressed. It is designed to be easy to use whatever hand you hold your device in.</p>
    <p>You can pinch-zoom or use the mouse wheel to adjust the size of the comic page. For books, the tools menu has zoom controls, allowing you to choose between some preset values or increase and decrease the text size as you see fit. The tools menu for a book also contains the table of contents for the book, and you can click on any chapter to jump to that position in the book. If you have a keyboard, use arrow keys or W/A/S/D to navigate.</p>
    <p>When reading a comic, press left mouse and drag or touch screen and drag to adjust the position of the comic page. A double left click or a double tap on the center of the screen zooms you in or out on the comic page.</p>
