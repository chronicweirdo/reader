# Reader

A very simple web-reader app. Should support the following functionality:

- be able to show contents of CBR and EPUB files in a web page
- store a library of those files
- be able to sync position in those files across devices
- allow, where possible, the storage of notes on those files
- if all this works well, extend to other file types (CBZ, PDF)
